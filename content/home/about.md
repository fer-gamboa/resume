I have been playing videogames since I was a child. They can be not only fun, but also teach you, change you and create a lasting memory. After learning to program by myself, I realized I wanted to contribute to the gaming community in more ways than being a gamer: I hoped to create and develop games that would engage people and have a positive impact on them.

Besides that, I am a computer hardware enthusiast, and keep myself informed in different trends and products available on the market. I consider it an important aspect, and enjoy assembling my own computers from scratch.

I am currently taking the last courses of the _Bachelor in Game Design and Development_ at Universidad Nacional del Litoral, in Santa Fe, Argentina. My ETA for graduation is the first semester of 2019. I am currently interest in any internship or junior position in the videogames development industry.
