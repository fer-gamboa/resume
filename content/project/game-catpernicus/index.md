This prototype game was developed as a final assignment for one the courses I undertook, namely “Developing Videogames III”. 

Catpernicus is a platformer game, with a little story: you play as a cat that needs to arrive to a secured place to deliver something. It has some touches of a stealth game, as you need to avoid enemies no matter what, as the cat (Catpernicus!) cannot attack or kill the monsters. But this isn’t strictly a stealth game, because only two types of enemies can “see” and attach the player, and one of them just “hears” it (sprinting is noisy, btw).

## The Idea

The aim of this game is to try to get back to those old platformers in which you learn by repetition. But I decided to add those touches of stealth games to have a little distinction. Also, as you play as a cat, you have only nine (9!) lives to spend, and you can’t recover them: loosing all 9 lives means a perma-death, and you start over from the beginning.

This game was developed entirely with Godot 3.1, and was my first big experience with that engine. I found it to be a great tool, with some strengths and weaknesses of course, but full of possibilities.


Here is a trailer featuring a short in-game footage:
