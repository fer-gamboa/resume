A platformer game intended for the casual player that enjoys jumping, dodging and fighting enemies while overcoming increasingly dangerous obstacles, in a retro pixel setting. Playable in a browser with basic keyboard controls.

This game is on alpha stage.

## The Idea
I developed this game for the final assignment for the course "Videogame Development (II)" for the Bachelor on Game Design & Development, at UNL FICH, Santa Fe, Argentina. The assignment required to developa game using HaxeFlixel, which had to:

- Be a platformer game with a main character.
- Use a tilemap (scenario).
- Have shooting, enemies and health items.
- Have entry and exit points on each level.
- And incorporate any new mechanich or challenge on each level.

Besides that, we could improvise and create anything to our liking. Based on that, I wanted to bring the retro-pixel style of old games where the challenge of overcoming increasing difficulties was the main drive of the game.

My final result was a simple, buy entertaining game, where each level requires strategic thinking in order to overcome the obstacles without mindlessly, repeatedly dying. I used simple and classic keyboard controls, so that any player can play intuitively, without struggling to decipher _how_ to play the game. 

Here is a trailer featuring a short in-game footage:

## Download

The game can be played in any web browser, but I recommend using Mozilla Firefox for it. <a href="https://fergamboa.itch.io/platformer-land" target="_blank">You can play it on my Itch.IO page</a>.

## Engines & Tools
I developed this game using Tiled to create the maps, and HaxeFlixel for the logic and main development. The trailer was recorded using [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) and edited in Photoshop CS3 and Sony Movie Studio.
