Casual smartphone/tablet fun arcade game, where you need to rescue as many cave-people as possible to overcome the flood. Use your device's gyroscope to control a raft, fight against current sweeps, wild animals and unforeseen events while you make your escape.

This game has a complete GDD. If you are interested, contact me to discuss it.

## Audience
The game is targeted to teenagers and young adults, wanting a casual, passtime game. It is a solo-game, where the players always face AI elements and challenges.

<br />

## Characteristics
The game is controled by the device's giroscope, which turns the wooden raft in different directions. It also has two touch controls, aimed to be used with the thumbs: rowing or counter-rowing the boat.

Different cave-people bring different qualities to your boat, and increase your score if you bring them to the safe shore successfully. Even more, each type of raft has different characteristics and is able to carry a given number of people.

The game features an in-game shop that sells visual changes only, such as seasons and outfits or rafts designs.
